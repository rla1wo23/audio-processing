# Audio-Signal Processing Repository

This repository contains the code I implemented while taking the Audio-Signal Processing course on Coursera. It includes practical exercises and assignments that I completed as part of the course.

## Directory Structure

- **assignments**: This directory contains the assignments I completed during the course. Feel free to browse through them, but please do not submit my work as your own!
- **practice**: These are practice files where I followed along with the course, primarily focusing on DFT-related code and exercises. I also experimented with additional implementations.

- **software**: This is a subdirectory containing tools from the `sms-tools` repository. Note that I did not write this software.

## Additional Tools

The software tools and auxiliary scripts used in this repository have been sourced from the following GitHub repository: [MTG/sms-tools](https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools).

If you wish to make full use of my software, please refer to this repository for instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies.
